# 🥞 Simple Pancake Recipe Website

This is a static recipe webpage built using **HTML and CSS**, based on a provided **Figma design**. The project showcases a classic Swedish pancake recipe with styled ingredients, instructions, and images – all laid out to match the original design as closely as possible.

> ✅ **This project was created as part of my application for a Frontend Web Development Bootcamp.**  
> It demonstrates my ability to interpret a design and translate it into HTML and styled CSS, after just two weeks of learning frontend development.

## 🧪 Work in Progress & Branches

This project is part of my learning journey in frontend development.

So far, I've created a new branch focused on improving **semantic HTML**:

🔀 **Branch: `semantic_html`**  
Includes improved use of semantic tags such as `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and better overall structure to enhance accessibility and readability.

More improvements will be added in future branches as I continue learning and practicing!
